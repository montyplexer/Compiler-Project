 # Compiler written in C++ for new language

At the moment, a basic expression evaluator is being worked on. The Lexer is being implemented.

Currently, the Lexer is able to tokenize arithmetic, logic, and comparison operators, as well as punctuals, keywords, identifiers, and numeral literals (distinguishing between integers and floats). There is more to come.
