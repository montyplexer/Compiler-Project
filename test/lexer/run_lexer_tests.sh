# Run unit tests for the Lexer
# For each test, determine if the actual output matched the expected output

# Test 1 - Determine type of token of a variety of literals (all on a single line)
# Test 2 - Checks if single-line comments are ignored AND only a single EOF token is printed
# Test 3 - Checks if multi-line comments are ignored AND only a single EOF token is printed
# Test 4 - Empty files should produce just one token of type EOF
# Test 5 - Test that all operators show up as valid operator tokens, and that operator symbols are ignored in comments
